    "## How do we normally store data? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been using a computer, chances are that you are familiar with storing data on your home drive, or on an external hard drive, or maybe even on the cloud. This is typically referred to as **File Storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With file storage, all data is stored together (usually in one file) and the file extension type helps determine the applications that can read or open the file and access the data (e.g., .jpg, .docx, or .txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "File storage systems also make it easier for users to find and manage files using a hierarchical structure that organizes files into folders and subfolders. To access the file, select or enter the path of the file, including subdirectories and file name. Most users manage their file storage using a simple file system such as a file manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other alternatives to the everyday local file storage, like network file storage (connect to the network server first then access by path/file) and *Object Storage*, which is most relevant to cloud-computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object storage** is like a giant virtual bucket where you can store your belongings in labelled boxes. Each box has a unique ID and can hold different types of objects. You can easily add or remove boxes as needed, and the bucket can expand to accommodate more and more boxes. Plus, you can access any box from anywhere in the world, if you have the ID and access permission. Object storage is ideal for storing vast amounts of unstructured data, such as videos, images, and documents, and is commonly used in cloud storage services. You can have many Buckets where you can store vast amounts of your data and they can all have different access permissions and life cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "EASI supports many types of data storage, local and network file storage and Object Storage, and each method has certain advantages, limitations and requirements. EASI also manages data for all users in the Open Data Cube, and there are third-party datasets accessible directly in the Cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional terms that may be helpful when talking about Data Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data latency is the time it takes for data packets to be stored or retrieved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of identifying and extracting data from a database or storage system, based on a query provided by the user or application. It enables the fetching of data from storage in order to display it on a monitor and/or use within an application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache** \n",
    "\n",
    "A high-speed memory or storage device that helps reduce the time required to read and write data to a slower device, such as a hard drive or a remote server (or bucket)."

    "\n",
    "**What is the Home Directory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Directory uses the Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic File System (EFS) storage architecture. This is similar to a normal network file system in that it has folders, sub folders and files and it is easy and familiar to navigate and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When would I use the Home Directory to store data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Directory is best used for small files including source code and notebooks and smaller sets of data outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the Home Directory to store files that cannot readily work from other storage options (i.e., files or programs that require a normal file system). Again, if these are large, then you may wish to find an alternative and your EASI Administrator will be happy to advise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the advantages of the Home Directory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data housed in your Home Directory is persistent through log-in/log-out cycles (your home directory will be as you left it). The home directory is also automatically backed-up nightly and retained for 90 days.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The EASI Admin team can restore a file. However this is not always guaranteed. If you are looking for more stable and long-term storage, there are better solutions out there! \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the limitations of the Home Directory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most expensive form of storage available on EASI. It is ok to store a Gigabyte or so of data, code and outputs. For larger datasets and outputs there are other EASI storage types available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your home directory is not visible to *Dask* workers, as they run in a different part of EASI. We will learn about the Python *Dask* library later in the module.\n",

At its core, the ODC is a set of Python libraries and PostgreSQL database that helps you work with geospatial raster data.\n",

So, you don’t need to worry about updates, maintenance, storage costs etc. Many EO and large public data collections are available, or becoming available, via the cloud. EASI and ODC connects directly to the current best collection endpoints and API services, and utilises cloud efficiencies and capabilities where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the data collections and processing routines are open source, and are contributed to by the ODC, research and domain-coordination communities.

    "The Datacube API may not suit your overall workflow.  Just remember that the datacube shows “one way to do it”. Talk to the EASI team about your workflow and we can advise what others options are available or could be combined. For example, you can access the list of files (rather than the data) that the datacube API would return for your query, and you can likely access the same sources that EASI’s workflows do.\n",

Scratch storage serves as a temporary location for large data sets that are more appropriate to save and access from AWS S3 storage. These could be intermediate datasets in your workflow or interim results for testing and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When would I use the User Scratch?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The User Scratch bucket is helpful to save files between processing runs or share files between your projects. You can use Scratch as large, efficient temporary storage for your workflows and projects, e.g. for saving intermediate results from your workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scratch can be accessed by *Dask* workers for passing data and saving snapshots of results, which is an advantage over Home Directory storage. Don’t know what *Dask* is? Don’t worry, we’ll cover Dask in detail.\n",

    "- Works with Dask workers (fast)\n",
    "- Has a managed lifetime, in case you forget it will (eventually) clean up after you\n",

    "User Scratch is *Object Storage*, which is a bit different to file storage, so it requires a different method to access and manage the data. Many tools support efficient read/write to cloud object storage directly but some older tools that you use may not. If so, use the AWS CLI to make a temporary copy of the files to your JupyterLab home directory or to dask workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, objects in the user scratch bucket have a 30-day (since date of creation) lifecycle rule. It is not intended for long-term data storage. Similarly, it is also not a practical solution if you need to share files and resources between projects, particularly beyond 30 days.

    "The “cloud” in this context refers to the main global cloud data companies – Amazon Web Services, Google Earth Engine and Microsoft Planetary Computer. However, the ideas mentioned here are also reasonably applicable to many internet-available datasets, although the specific way to access these may differ.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**What are the limitations of cloud-based data assets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost and efficiency mostly. While these cloud data collections are publicly available they are not necessarily free to access. The cloud companies typically charge network data transfer and related costs associated for moving data within, into and out of their systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, accessing data over the internet can slow workflow speed and repeated use in workflows will result in more network costs (possibly more than the cost of downloading the data and temporarily storing it). All these need to be managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small, infrequent access (like one off grabs of data) you can safely just use them. For large data use or frequent re-use then if you are unsure contact your EASI Admin and we’ll help you navigate. It’s not difficult, just awkward at the start to understand what to watch for.\n",

    "**How do I access and use cloud-based data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This varies depending on the data source and we can’t cover them all. However, there are common considerations highlighted below to help you think about how to use cloud-based data.

    "S3 bucket storage is preferred for data sets larger than a few GBs. Workflows (notebooks and dask workers) can read and write to S3 buckets if permitted. All EASI users have access to the User Scratch bucket. Some users may also have access to a Project data bucket, in which case the data can also be used by project colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 bucket storage is preferred for larger datasets because it is cheaper, efficient and programmable from notebooks and dask workers. Your home directory is more expensive and not accessible from dask workers, so is less suitable for workflows generating or using large datasets."

    "- Whether there is a programmable request interface, e.g. STAC API, an OGC web service, or a custom API. For STAC APIs, you can use the odc-stac tool to query and read the data into an xarray object. Similarly, there are common python tools for reading from ODC web services. A custom API will likely need specific code to search, download and prepare the data for use.\n",
    "- Where the data are located. Cloud data services (including EASI’s host) often charge for each data transaction into and out of their data centres, which add up. Moving data across the internet can be slow as well. Ask the EASI team for advice.\n",
    "- Is this a candidate dataset for including in the datacube database? If yes, then a great start is to document how this dataset can be used by you and others, the dataset source and metadata, and some example code for accessing and using the dataset."
