    "## How do we normally store data? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been using a computer, chances are that you are familiar with storing data on your home drive, or on an external hard drive, or maybe even on the cloud. This is typically referred to as **File Storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With file storage, all data is stored together (usually in one file) and the file extension type helps determine the applications that can read or open the file and access the data (e.g., .jpg, .docx, or .txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "File storage systems also make it easier for users to find and manage files using a hierarchical structure that organizes files into folders and subfolders. To access the file, select or enter the path of the file, including subdirectories and file name. Most users manage their file storage using a simple file system such as a file manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other alternatives to the everyday local file storage, like network file storage (connect to the network server first then access by path/file) and *Object Storage*, which is most relevant to cloud-computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object storage** is like a giant virtual bucket where you can store your belongings in labelled boxes. Each box has a unique ID and can hold different types of objects. You can easily add or remove boxes as needed, and the bucket can expand to accommodate more and more boxes. Plus, you can access any box from anywhere in the world, if you have the ID and access permission. Object storage is ideal for storing vast amounts of unstructured data, such as videos, images, and documents, and is commonly used in cloud storage services. You can have many Buckets where you can store vast amounts of your data and they can all have different access permissions and life cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "EASI supports many types of data storage, local and network file storage and Object Storage, and each method has certain advantages, limitations and requirements. EASI also manages data for all users in the Open Data Cube, and there are third-party datasets accessible directly in the Cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional terms that may be helpful when talking about Data Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data latency is the time it takes for data packets to be stored or retrieved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of identifying and extracting data from a database or storage system, based on a query provided by the user or application. It enables the fetching of data from storage in order to display it on a monitor and/or use within an application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache** \n",
    "\n",
    "A high-speed memory or storage device that helps reduce the time required to read and write data to a slower device, such as a hard drive or a remote server (or bucket)."

    "\n",
    "**What is the Home Directory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Directory uses the Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic File System (EFS) storage architecture. This is similar to a normal network file system in that it has folders, sub folders and files and it very easy and familiar to navigate and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When would I use the Home Directory to store data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Directory is best used for small files including source code and notebooks and smaller sets of data outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the Home Directory to store files that cannot readily work from other storage options (i.e., files or programs that require a normal file system). Again, if these are large, then you may wish to find an alternative and your EASI Administrator will be happy to advise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the advantages of the Home Directory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data housed in your Home Directory is persistent through log-in/log-out cycles (you will see your home directory in the state as you left it). The home directory is also automatically backed-up nightly and retained for 90 days.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The EASI Admin team can restore a file. However this is not always guaranteed. If you are looking for more stable and long-term storage, there are better solutions out there! \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the limitations of the Home Directory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most expensive form of storage available on EASI. It is ok to store a Gigabyte or so of data, code and outputs. For larger datasets and outputs there are other EASI storage types available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your home directory is not visible to *Dask* workers, as they run in a different part of EASI. We will learn about the Python *Dask* library later in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do I upload and use data?**\n",

    "There’s a video of this and information in the [Jupyter labs documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For small files, it is simplest to drag-and-drop your files into the JupyterLab file interface directly from your desktop. This will upload the file via your browser into your home directory.\n",
    "- For larger files, it's best to use the AWS CLI running locally along with your EASI credentials and upload directly to your [EASI S3 User Scratch space](#User-Scratch) space.\n",

At its core, the ODC is a set of Python libraries and PostgreSQL database that helps you work with geospatial raster data.\n",

    "The broad goal of the ODC is to make it easier to access and use large data holdings, without requiring data to be stored in a specific way or in a specific place.

So, you don’t need to worry about updates, maintenance, storage costs etc. Many EO and large public data collections are available, or becoming available, via the cloud. EASI and ODC connects directly to the current best collections endpoints and API services, and utilises cloud efficiencies and capabilities where possible.\n",
