Jupyter notebooks for learning and advancing your use of EASI, https://research.csiro.au/cceo/underpinning-technologies/earth-analytics/.

- Use the examples in these notebooks to build your own data analysis and applications.
- These notebooks have been adapted and written for CSIRO's EASI deployments.

These notebooks build on and contribute to the [Open Data Cube](https://github.com/opendatacube), [CEOS](https://ceos.org) and cloud-based EO analytics communities ([Acknowledgment and Credit](../README.md#Acknowledgment-and-Credit)).

## HTML notebooks

The HTML versions are built by the [pre-commit hook](../bin/pre-commit) ([Contributing](../README.md#Contributing)). The HTML notebooks are rendered by [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com).
